TODO
====
* Merge VphasOffsetPointing and VphasOffsetCatalogue into one class.
* Plots PSFs in one bitmap.
* Remove objects with large shifts altogether?
* Ensure the merged output catalogue has the right column order of bands.
* Is the photometry for stars at the edges of masked-out areas reliable?
* Recover notes from my laptop.
* Avoid writing subimage and seepsf during source list iteration.
* Avoid pyraf from doing: "Created directory /home/gb/dev/surveytools/sandbox/catalogue/pyraf for cache"
* Can reduce maxnpsf during source list building?
